// The original intent of the designers of this module was to keep this module
// completely independent of CS-MAP.  However, since ANSI seem to be obstinant
// about adding wcsicmp to the standard, we need access to the CS_wcsicmp
// function in CS-MAP.  We could have duplicated the CS_wcsicmp code here, but
// we chose not to.  Anyway, wcsicmp is the only reason cs_map.h is included
// here (at least as of this writing: March 2009).  If the include of
// "cs_map.h" is removed for any reason, you'll need to add an include of
// <math.h> to get this to compile.

// Now comes May 21, 2014 
// The following list, and the order of their listing, has been optimized for
// the use of pre-compiled headers.  Some of these files are unreferenced in

// csGetCsvRecord -- Extracts a record from a .csv file as a wstring.
//
// Extracts a .csv record from a stream.  Essentially a "get line of text into
// a wstring" function, except that this is smart enough to be able to recognize
// and simply copy new-line characters within a quoted field.  The function
// clears the provided string before processing, and DOES NOT include the
// terminating new line.  An empty line causes an empty string to be returned.
// Users are advised to use 'reserve' method on the csvRecord parameter before
// passing to this function to preserve performance.
//
// Returns a value of the EcsCsvStatus enumeration.  Possible values are:
// csvOk            -> record was extracted successfully
// csvRecordTooLong -> a resulting string with more than 100,000 characters
// csvEndInQuote    -> encountering a end-of-file within a quoted string
// csvLastWasEsc    -> a file whose last character is not a new line character
// csvInvRecord     -> invalid record format with regard to quoted fields

//
// The following does a CSV parse.  Note that:

// 1> there MUST NOT be a trailing line break in the provided csvRecord
//    argument.
// 2> the delimiters argument can provide user specified delimeters:
//		[0] == separator
//		[1] == quote
//		[2] == escape
// 3> if delimiters is the null pointer, hardcoded default values are used:
//		separator == comma,
//		quote     == double quote
//		escape    == double quote
// 4> regardless how set, if the quote character equals the escape
//    character, the quote character is escaped in a quoted field only
//    by two consecutive quote characters.
// 5> regardless how set, if the escape character is not the same as
//    the quote character, the escape character will escape anything
//    in a quoted field, including the quote character of course.
// 6> this function executes a fields.clear () on the fields agrument.
// 7> this function operates on 16 bit UNICODE characters only.
// 8> the fields vector is populated with a std::wstring for each
//    field in the provided record as determined by the separator
//    character.  An empty field produces an empty std::wstring.
//    The returned std::wstrings may include line breaks if such
//    were present within a quoted value.
// 9> the csGetCsvRecord defined above is useful in extracting
//    records from a CSV file when a quoted field may have
//    line breaks in it; often the case when the CSV file is
//    exported by Acess, Excel, or similar programs.
//
// Returns a value of the EcsCsvStatus enumeration.  Possible values are:
//
//  csvOk            -> record successfully parsed
//  csvEndInQuote    -> Record ended within a quoted field
//  csvInvLineBrk    -> Line break not in quote.
//  csvLastWasEsc    -> Last character in record was an escape character
//  csvAmbigQuote    -> Non-space data after quote, before separator
//  csvInvRecord     -> improper record format.
//  csvFieldTooLong  -> A field longer than 10,000 characters was encountered
//  csvTooManyFields -> Record appeared to have more than 300 fields.
//  csvInternal      -> Internal error in parser
//
//..10,000 character limit and 300 field limit were arbitrarily chosen simply
//..to prevent infinte loop/crash when processing a completely bogus file;
//..that is bogus from a CSV standpoint of view.
