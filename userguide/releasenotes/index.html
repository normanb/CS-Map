<h1 id="distributionrelease-notes">Distribution/Release Notes</h1>
<p>Due to distribution permission issues, it was determined that the polynomial coefficients for the System 34 coordinate conversions could not be open sourced.  Thus, to properly incorporate Syatem 34 capabilities into your application, you will need to obtain a copy of these coefficients for yourself. Refer to the source module named CSsys34KMS.c for details.</p>
<h2 id="csv-file-support">CSV File Support</h2>
<p>Implemented as a C++ object, there now exists rather substantial support for reading and writing data
file in the CSV (comma separated value) format.</p>
<h2 id="epsg-support">EPSG Support</h2>
<p>Still a work inprogress, there now exists substantial support for accessing data provided by the EPSG
Parameter Dataset.  As this dataset is traditionally distributed in Microsoft Access format, this facility
relies on the conversion of all EPSG data tables to .CSV format, and uses the new CSV FIle SUpport
object to access them.</p>
<h2 id="wkt-flavor-support">WKT Flavor Support</h2>
<p>Using the new Name Mapper facility, CS-MAP's ability to handle various flavors of WKT has been
imporved.  There is lots yet to be done, but a non-trivial improvement in the accuracy and number of
flavors supported.</p>
<p>So, there remains much to do to bring this document up to the standard desired by the CS-MAP
contributor team.  For now, it's important to provide potential users with the basic information
necessary to get started using CS-MAP.</p>
<h1 id="the-distribution">The Distribution</h1>
<p>Detailed instructions on how to obtain the distribution are available at
<a href="http://trac.osgeo.org/csmap/wiki/HowToGetTheSourceCode">http://trac.osgeo.org/csmap/wiki/HowToGetTheSourceCode</a></p>
<p>The distribution includes many somewhat voluminous grid data files known to OSGeo as being in the
public domain.  There are several such grid data files which are not in the public domain and which
must be obtained from the source on an individual user basis.  Simple registration is all that is required
in many cases, license fees are rarely required.  Mostly, the issuing authority just wants to keep track of
who is using the data in order to adhere to ISO quality control standards.</p>
<p>The Canadian National Transformation data file is, perhaps, the most widely used example of a grid
data file which OSGeo is not permitted to distribute.  You and your clients will need to obtain this file
from the Canadian government. A license fee is no longer required, but Geomatics Canada still needs
to know who is using the data file.  Contact: <a href="../www.geod.nrcan.gc.ca">www.geod.nrcan.gc.ca</a></p>
<p>Since the distribution cannot include a copy of the Canadian National Transformation file, the test
cases for this transformation are commented out in the provided TEST.DAT file.  After obtaining the
Canadian National Transformation file, you will probably want to uncomment these test cases from the
test file.</p>
<p>Typically, a README.txt file is placed in the folder in which an undistributable grid data files would
normally reside.  THis text file will usually provide information as to how to obtain a copy of the data
file.  When a CS-MAP error message which indicates that a file is missing is encountered, check to see
if there is not a README.txt file in the folder in which CS-MAP was looking for the file and examine
its contents.</p>
<h1 id="source-layout">Source Layout</h1>
<h2 id="include-directory">Include Directory</h2>
<p>You don't need to be a genius to figure out that all header files are installed into this sub-directory.
What might surprise you is that there is only one real header file: <code>cs_map.h</code>.  While this file is quite
large, the precompiled header feature of most modern compilers make this approach most convenient.</p>
<p>Also, you never have to guess in which header file a specific item is defined in. They're all defined in
<code>cs_map.h</code>.  Neither do you have to wonder which files must be included into your application; <code>cs_map.h</code>
is the one.  There are other include files, but are those required by the rather strange environment used
for MFC development.</p>
<p>The <code>cs_map.h</code> header file will specifically include two files.  The files, and exactly where they are
included, are described below.  These provide a means by which users can incorporate their own
features without having to modify <code>cs_map.h</code> after each new release.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cs_clientBeg.h</code> --  The inclusion of this file occurs immediately after the check for a previous include
of <code>cs_map.h</code>, but before the <code>cs_map.h</code> file does anything else.  An excellent place to place defines
which control the environment of the compilation.</li>
<li><code>cs_clientEnd.h</code> -- The inclusion of this file occurs immediately before the <code>#endif</code> which terminates
the multiple inclusion protection.  That is, it is included after everything else in <code>cs_map.h</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="library-source-code">Library Source Code</h2>
<p>The directory named Source will contain all source code to the library proper.  The source code
components of CS-MAP are normally compiled and the resulting objects used to construct an object
module library.  Source code to dictionary compilers and test programs are provided elsewhere.  Make
files for building the library are provided in this folder.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Library.mak</code> can used used to build the object library in the Linux environment.</li>
<li><code>Library.nmk</code> can use used int the Microsoft WIndows environment using the nmake facility.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the make files includes a list of all the modules that belong in the library.  This list represents
most of the drudgery of creating a make file.  Adjust the actual rules as necessary for your
platform/compiler.  Notice that leaving the manifest constant <code>__MFC__</code> undefined will cause all MFC
related code to be skipped during the compilation process.  Obviously, if compiling in an environment
other than Windows 32/64, be sure to leave the <code>__MFC__</code> constant undefined.</p>
<h2 id="dictionary-source-code-and-data">Dictionary Source Code and Data</h2>
<p>The directory named Dictionaries will contain the source code to the dictionary compiler, and the data
files which this compiler compiles to produce the binary form of the Category Dictionary, the
Coordinate System Dictionary, the Datum Dictionary, the Ellipsoid Dictionary, and the Multiple
Regression Transformation data files.  Be sure to compile these dictionaries with the <code>/t</code> option if you
intend to run the CS-MAP test program.  </p>
<p>Make files for building the compiler are provided in this folder.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Compiler.mak</code> can used used to build the compiler in the Linux environment.</li>
<li><code>Compiler.nmk</code> can use used to build the compiler in the Microsoft Windows environment using the nmake facility.</li>
</ul>
<p>The distribution also uses this directory to convey sample Geodetic Data Catalogs which you will
definitely want to inspect and perhaps modify.  Geodetic data files which OSGeo believes to be in the
public domain are deposited in sub-folders of this folder in a specific hierarchy.  This hierarchy is
consistent with the provided Geodetic Data Catalog (.gdc) files.  There is no specific requirement for
the location of the geodetic data files other than their location must be consistent with the
specifications int he Geodetic Data Catalog files.</p>
<p>Also please note that the OSTN97.TXT and OSTN02.TXT data files must also reside in the primary data
directory.  Again, by design, there is only one file for each of these transformations, and the
implementation of a Geodetic Data Catalog file was skipped.  Also, due to the rather strange nature of
these files, most of the features of a Geodetic Data Catalog file do not apply anyway.</p>
<h2 id="test-source-code-and-data">Test Source Code and Data</h2>
<p>The directory named Test will contain the source code to the CS-MAP test program and the supporting
data file, TEST.DAT. Compilation and linking of this program will obviously require the inclusion of the
header file and library.  Make files for building the test program are provided in this folder.</p>
<ul>
<li>Test.mak can used used to build the test program in the Linux environment.</li>
<li>Test.nmk can use used int the Microsoft WIndows environment using the nmake facility.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to execute the entire test sequence, you will need to have compiled the dictionaries with the <code>/t</code>
option.  This causes the retention of the test coordinate systems (not normally distributed with an
application) in the dictionary files.  The test program will also expect to have access to the NADCON
and HPGN data files provided in the sub-directories of the Dictionaries directory.  When executing the
test program, use the <code>/d</code> option to indicate the location of the directory in which the dictionaries,
NADCON, and HPGN data files reside; e.g. /d..\Dictionaries.</p>
<p>This program performs a fairly substantial test of most all features and capabilities of CS-MAP.  This
program should be used each time CS-MAP is used in a new configuration or compiled with a different
compiler.</p>
<p>Note that a large number of the tests encoded in the TEST.DAT file are commented out as they rely on
the existence of specific geodetic data files which OSGeo cannot distribute.  For example, since
OSGeo cannot distribute the Canadian National Transformation, all test dependent upon that data file
are commented out.  Upon obtaining geodetic data files which Mentor Software cannot distribute, you
should consider un-commenting the tests related to such files.</p>
<h2 id="documentation-directory">Documentation Directory</h2>
<p>The directory named Documentation is where you will find a copy of this documentation.  Depending
upon the format, it may consist of a single file, or a directory containing multiple files.  A printable
version may also be present.</p>
<p>Additionally, this directory will contain the source code to the help file which is provided for use with
the MFC based components of CS-MAP.  The source code files include an .rtf file, a contents file (.cnt),
and several screen shots in .bmp format.  Again, a make file compatible with Visual C++ Version 6 (or
later) nmake is provided; it is named <code>help.nmk</code>.  (As the help file is not generally usable in the Linux
environment, no Linux compatible make file is provided.)  Note, that the CS-MAP MFC based
functions expect to find the help file in the same directory as the mapping data files.  Of course, a
function exists which enables application programmers to override this default location
(CS_setHelpPath).  If for any reason, the MFC based functions cannot locate the help file, the help
button on all dialogs will be grayed out.</p>
<p>Please note that the help file is designed for distribution with your application.  It does not mention
OSGeo, CS-MAP, or the original developers of CS-MAP.  It uses a rather generic term "coordinate
conversion system" to refer to that which it is describing.</p>
<h2 id="data-directory">Data Directory</h2>
<p>Several data files used in the construction of CS-MAP's Name Mapper facility are included in the Data
directory.  It is envisioned that these files will be replaced by a more convenient and controllable
means in the near future.</p></div>
