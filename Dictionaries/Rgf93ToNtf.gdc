# Europe: RGF93 to NTF
#
# Each line points to a datum shift data file.  In the case of
# overlapping coverage, the program selects the data file with
# the smallest grid cell in the region of the conversion.  If
# the grid cell sizes are the same, the program selects the
# file which appears first in this file.  Check the Help
# file for more options.
#
# Order the list of files as appropriate for your application.
# You can add additional files as they become available.  While
# the name, and location of the file name is not important, the
# extension must be ".gsb" if the file is in the Canadian National
# Transformation, Version 2, format.  Each line may be a full path name.
# The ".\" sequence used here is a relative folder/directory reference,
# relative to the folder (directory) in which this file resides.
#
# During the development required to support local grid files in France,
# it was determined that while the national file (which has been supported
# for many years) defines a shift from RGF93 to NTF, the local grid files
# define a shift from NTF to RGF93.  Thus, due to legacy reasons, this
# GDC file is named "Rgf93ToNtf.gdc", even though the local grid files
# actually define a transformation from NTF to RGF93.  Sorry for any
# confusion which this may cause.
#
# Also note, that all data shift files are expected to be in little
# endian order, regardless of the platform upon which this product is
# running.  Bytes will be swapped as is appropriate by the product.

# The fallback datum definition is used when none of the above
# listed files provides coverage for the point to be converted.
# The specification given below (in the distribution data anyway),
# says to use the definition NTF-G in this case.  This definition
# is a Molodensky based definition.  Of course, you can change this
# to whatever datum definition you prefer.  It must be a definition
# which exists in the Datum Dictionary, which does not rely on a
# specific grid shift data file.
#
# Definitions in the Datum Dictionary are required to define the
# transformation appropriate for transformation datum coordinates
# to WGS84.  Therefore, the datum definition listed as a fallback
# must be a definition that converts NTF to RGF93/WGS84.  This is
# true even though this GDC file is named 'Rgf93ToNtf.gdc' for the
# reasons described above.
